# TL;DR

Helper uploads a folder of json indexd records.

## Use

```
  gen3 indexd-post-folder [folder]:
      Post the .json files under the given folder to indexd
      in the current environment: $DEST_DOMAIN
      Note - currently only works with new records - does not
         attempt to update existing records.
```
